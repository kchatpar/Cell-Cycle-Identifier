# Scripts from my summer internship in Dan Landau's Lab at New York Genome Center and Weil Cornell Medical School.
# A cells life cycle includes going through the Mitosis(M), G1, S, G2 and back to Mitosis. The two transition checkpoints are G1/S and G2/M.
# The goal of this project was to quantify in a given sample how many cells are in between stages such as in the G1/S and G2/M stage.
# I used sequencing data to detertmine which stage of life a single cell is in.
# My scripts were all built using R.
